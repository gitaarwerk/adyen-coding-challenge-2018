# Adyen Coding Challenge

## Platform choice

I chose React & Redux because it is fast to setup and easy to develop. Since the application is a user-focused app, location based, I felt that this app supposed to run mostly on a mobile device.
Using react, redux a material design library and using some of the functionalities of a progressive web app, it means the user gets a good mobile experience that is known to him/her, without loosing the time you normally used to setup the framework.

## Setting things up

I chose to use react-create-app, to bootstrap react. I could do this manually, but there is no reason for a short coding session to do this.

## Why Material design?

Material Design by Google is used on most of people's smartphone. Even Apple apps sometimes use this. This means that many users most likely have seen this kind of UI already.
I also have experience using the [Material UI component library](https://www.material-ui.com). The library is not perfect when it comes to the elements supplied, however, it does a fairly well job. It contains the basic elements and works exactly how Google intended this described on its [Material IO](https://www.material.io) website.
